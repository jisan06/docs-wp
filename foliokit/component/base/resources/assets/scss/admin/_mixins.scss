/**
 * Flexbox
 * =======
 * Flexbox when the WP menu is sticky
 * If menu is not sticky the whole page has to scroll to be able to view the sidemenu
 *
 * 1. Is flexbox variable set to true?
 * 2. Make sure to place selector at root since we use modernizr (add classes to html tag)
 * 3. Check for modernizr classes
 * 4. Set media query
 *
 * Because we're adding .flexbox and .flexboxlegacy classes flexbox will only work when JS is enabled
 * This is a good thing since we're not sure what we're showing / hiding with JS that might mess with flexbox
